# snap

**Requirements**

The task is to simulate a game of snap between two players using standard playing card decks.

1. The application should ask the user how many playing card decks to play with
2. The application should shuffle the decks before play commences
3. Games of snap should now be simulated. Cards are played one at a time and when two matching cards are dealt one after another the first player to shout snap wins. (You do not need to implement the case of a draw round)
4. The winner of each round collects all the cards dealt in this round
5. Once all cards in the deck are exhausted the application should declare the winner based on who has the most won cards
